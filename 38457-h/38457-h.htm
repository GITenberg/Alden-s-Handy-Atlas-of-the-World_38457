  population, 3,000. The Liberians have established churches and schools,
  and possess a number of printing presses. The climate, which is still
  fatal to Europeans, has been much improved by systematic drainage.</p>
  <p>The country is well watered, and the natural resources are very great.
  Cotton and coffee are both indigenous, the former yielding two crops per
  year. The oil palm is abundant, palm oil, ivory, India rubber and nuts
  being the chief exports.</p>
<p class="cenhead"><span class="bighd">CONGO FREE STATE.</span></p>
  <p>The Act defining and constituting the Congo Free State was signed by
  the International Congo Conference at Berlin, February 26, 1885. The area
  of the State is estimated at 1,056,200 square miles, with a population of
  27,000,000. While the Congo state is under the sovereignty of the King of
  Belgium, the latter country or government has no power or responsibility
  in relation to it. The state is divided into four Provinces,&mdash;the
  Lower Congo, the Upper Congo, Livingstone Falls and the Pool, and the
  district between the Pool and Equator. The government is in the hands of
  an Administrator General, under whom are a number of white subordinates,
  chiefs of Provinces and other officials.</p>
  <p>Free commerce, in its widest sense, has been established in the basin
  of the Congo, and for a distance of 360 miles along the Atlantic. In this
  territory, no import duties can be levied for twenty years, and the
  Powers reserve the right to decide if freedom of entry shall be
  maintained beyond that period. The principal articles for export are said
  to be palm oil, ivory, rubber, gum copal, ground nuts, orchilla weed and
  cam-wood; principal imports are textiles, spirits, tobacco, guns and
  powder. <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The Netherlands Indies are by far the most important colonial
  possessions of the Netherlands. They cover all the Dutch possessions in
  the East Indies, and include Java, Madura, Banca, Sumatra, Bingtang,
  Billiton, Celebes, the Moluccas, Lombok Bali, and many smaller islands
  and parts of New Guinea, Borneo and Timor. Area of the colonies estimated
  at 636,329 square miles; population, 27,784,959. The superior
  administration is in the hands of a Governor General, assisted by a
  Council of 5 members.</p>
  <p>The most important colony is Java, which politically includes the
  neighboring island of Madura. Total area, 50,848 square miles;
  population, 20,259,450. Java is governed under what is termed the culture
  system, which was established in 1832.</p>
  <p>The strength of the total army in 1883 was 30,421 men, of whom 15,032
  were Europeans, and 15,389 natives. There is a military academy near
  Batavia, and attached to every battalion is a school for soldiers. The
  navy, royal and colonial, consisted of 79 vessels and 5,029 men.</p>
  <p>By far the larger part of the commerce of Dutch India is with the
  Netherlands. The average value of the total imports for three years was
  $62,500,000: exports, $75,000,000. About two-thirds of the imports were
  from the Netherlands, and three-fourths of the exports were sent to that
  country. The principal exports are sugar, coffee, rice, indigo and
  tobacco. Latest reports give value of coffee exported, $13,086,790;
  sugar, $19,625,470; indigo, $1,245,170; spices, $1,021,720; tobacco,
  $6,457,680.</p>
  <p>The Netherlands Indies had, in 1882, 3,682 miles of telegraph, with 84
  offices. Number of postoffices, 221. Java has now about 750 miles of
  railway.</p>
<p class="cenhead"><span class="bighd">HAWAII (SANDWICH ISLANDS).</span><span class="gap"></span>Ha-wi´ee.</p>
  <p>A kingdom of Oceania, consisting of a group of 15 islands, of which 8
  are inhabited. The government is a limited monarchy. Hawaii is the
  largest island; but Honolulu, the capital, is situated on the island of
  Oahu. Population of Honolulu, 7,000. Area of the islands, 6,667 square
  miles. At the last census, the population numbered 57,985: male, 34,103;
  female, 23,882; native, 44,088; Chinese, 5,916; white, 4,561, of whom
  1,276 were Americans, 883 English, 436 Portuguese, 272 Germans, 81
  French; half-caste, 3,420.</p>
  <p>To a great extent the islands are mountainous, and there are numerous
  volcanoes, several of which are active. The volcano of Mauna Loa, on the
  Island of Hawaii, is one of the highest active volcanoes in the world.
  The soil is exceedingly fertile and productive. Chief products, sugar and
  rice; but coffee, hides, bone, whale oil and wool are exported in
  considerable quantities. Value of exports, 1883, $8,121,200; imports,
  $5,624,240.</p>
  <p>In 1883, 267 vessels, of 183,316 tons, entered, and 263 vessels, of
  189,494 tons, cleared the ports. Of the former, 195 vessels were
  American. The islands own 64 vessels, of 15,588 tons. The islands of
  Hawaii and Maui are provided with telegraphs, and have about 32 miles of
  railway. Almost every house in Honolulu has its telephone.</p>
  <p>There are numerous schools in the islands; the annual sum devoted to
  public instruction is $95,850. The King is a member of the Church of
  England; but all forms of religion are permitted and protected. <!-- Page

  25°; at Sitka, about 44°; winter temperature at latter place about that
  of Washington, D.C. Rainfall copious, and foggy weather common on coasts
  and islands; Sitka one of rainiest places in the world outside the
  tropics, the annual precipitation being 65 to 90 inches, and number rainy
  days 200 to 285.</p>
  <p>Sitka is seat of Bishop of Greek church, and headquarters of the
  Governor, who assumed official control, December, 1884. Pop., 995: white,
  163; creole, 219; Thlinket, 613. Other settlements next in importance are
  Fort St. Nicholas, Cook's Inlet and Fort St. Michael, Norton's Sound.

  <p>Aleutian and Sitka districts are the agricultural regions. Most
  fertile land near Cook's Inlet; good oats, barley and root crops are
  raised here without much difficulty. Rich grass land in the valley of
  Yukon, but extreme dampness and want of summer heat prevent the ripening
  of grain. Timber abundant on mainland; yellow cedar the best, being of
  great value for boat-building. Edible berries are plentiful.</p>
  <p>A fine quality of white marble is found on Lynn Channel; coal, amber
  and lignite on Aleutian Islands, the best coal being on Cook's Inlet.
  Gold, silver, copper, cinnabar and iron are found; sulphur is abundant in
  volcanic districts.</p>
  <p>Noted for its fur-bearing animals, the chief of which are beaver,
  ermine, fox, marten, otter, squirrel and wolf. The main source of revenue
  is the fur seal, the taking of which is regulated by law. The United
  States receives a revenue from the company to which the monopoly of the
  trade is granted. The walrus is of value in furnishing ivory and oil.
  Whales, cod, herring and halibut abound, and various species of salmon
  are found. <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
